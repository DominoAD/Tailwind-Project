# Action Outline:

## Have Intro

* Opening Shot: Start with an eye-catching video intro featuring the Tailwind CSS logo and snapshots of popular websites that utilize Tailwind CSS for their design. Use dynamic transitions and make it engaging.

* Introduce Tailwind CSS: Briefly explain what Tailwind CSS is, touching on its utility-first approach to styling. Highlight its rapid adoption in the web development community.

* Pros and Cons: Discuss the advantages of using Tailwind CSS. Despite a steeper learning curve, the framework allows for faster prototyping and a high degree of customization.

## Describe use case

* Target Audience: Explain who typically uses Tailwind CSS.

* Comparison with Traditional CSS.

* Demo Overview: outline what we will be doing in the demo.

	
## Start Demo

### Preparation:

Open Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

Show the installation process, including Node.js if necessary, as Tailwind requires Node.js to compile its CSS.

### Activity 1: Project Setup

Begin by creating a new project directory and navigate into it.

Initialize a new npm project with `npm init -y`

Install Tailwind CSS via npm: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

Create your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files by running `npx tailwindcss init -p`

Inside the `tailwind.config.js` add paths to all of your template files `["./src/**/*.{html,js}]"`

**The file should look like this:**

	/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
	module.exports = {
	  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
	  theme: {
    extend: {},
	  },
	  plugins: [],
	}

### Folder Structure:

You should then create the `src` file at the root of your project.
Within `src` create the `index.html` and `input.css` files.

* Then run `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch`

### At this point, your file structure should be:
	node_modules	package-lock.json	package.json	postcss.config.js	tailwind.config.js
	

Focus on creating the public, src, and within src, the assets, components, styles, and utilities directories.

### Tailwind Integration:
In the `src/styles/tailwind.css` file, demonstrate how to import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities using Tailwind's directives.

Show how to set up the `postcss.config.js` to process the Tailwind file.

### Creating a Simple Page:

Create a basic HTML file in the public directory and link the compiled CSS file.

Start with a simple example, like adding a button or a card component, to demonstrate the utility classes in action.

### Running Tailwind:

Depending on your setup, explain how to compile the CSS using Tailwind CLI or a build tool like Webpack.

Show the command to watch for changes in your project and automatically rebuild your CSS file.
	
## Slow Down so People Can Keep up

**Pacing:** Make sure to pace the tutorial so that viewers have enough time to follow along. Avoid rushing through commands and explanations.

**Clarifications:** Periodically pause to explain why certain steps are taken and how Tailwind's utility classes work. This helps in understanding rather than just copying commands.

**Encourage Experimentation:** Towards the end, encourage viewers to experiment with Tailwind's classes in their components, suggesting they try to create a layout or component on their own.
