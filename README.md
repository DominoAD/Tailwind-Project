## Start Demo

### Preparation:

Open Visual Studio Code or your preferred code editor.

Show the installation process, including Node.js if necessary, as Tailwind requires Node.js to compile its CSS.

### Project Setup:

Begin by creating a new project directory and navigate into it.

Initialize a new npm project with `npm init -y`

Install Tailwind CSS via npm: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`

Create your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files by running `npx tailwindcss init -p`

### Folder Structure Setup:

	Document structure:
	
	project-root/
	│
	├── public/                     
	│   └── index.html              
	│
	├── src/                        
	│   ├── assets/                 
	│   │
	│   ├── components/             
	│   │   ├── Button.vue          
	│   │   ├── Card.js             
	│   │   └── ...
	│   │
	│   ├── styles/                 
	│   │   ├── tailwind.css

	│   │
	│   ├── utilities/              
	│   │   └── ...
	│   │
	│   ├── App.vue                 
	│   ├── App.js                  
	│   └── index.js                
	│
	├── tailwind.config.js          
	├── postcss.config.js           
	└── package.json

Guide viewers in setting up the described folder structure within the project directory.

Focus on creating the public, src, and within src, the assets, components, styles, and utilities directories.

### Tailwind Integration:
In the `src/styles/tailwind.css` file, demonstrate how to import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities using Tailwind's directives.

Show how to set up the `postcss.config.js` to process the Tailwind file.

### Creating a Simple Page:

Create a basic HTML file in the public directory and link the compiled CSS file.

Start with a simple example, like adding a button or a card component, to demonstrate the utility classes in action.

### Running Tailwind:
Explain how to compile the CSS using Tailwind CLI or through a build tool like Webpack, depending on your setup.

Show the command to watch for changes in your project and automatically rebuild your CSS file.
	
## Slow Down so People Can Keep up

**Pacing:** Make sure to pace the tutorial so that viewers have enough time to follow along. Avoid rushing through commands and explanations.

**Clarifications:** Periodically pause to explain why certain steps are taken and how Tailwind's utility classes work. This helps in understanding rather than just copying commands.

**Encourage Experimentation:** Towards the end, encourage viewers to experiment with Tailwind's classes in their components, suggesting they try to create a layout or component on their own.
